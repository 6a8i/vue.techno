            "comment": "In terms of functionality, behavior and quality, this is what is expected of any Apple product. Only the battery disappoints, with an average duration of 1 day, depending on usage, number of notifications, calls, etc. It does not have native sleep tracking, so it is necessary to install a third party application. GPS sometimes has some \"flaws\", recording routes a little out of reality. There are other more accurate products, with bigger battery, more features and cheaper, but for those who have iPhone, this is the best choice."
